The program makes use of the Student and LinkedList classes to create and manipulate the list of students. The Student class defines the properties and methods of a student object, while the LinkedList class defines the properties and methods of a linked list that stores student objects. Linked stack is used to store the student objects and a linked list to keep track of the students' objects which are sorted according to their ranks. In the main part the infinite loop is created to offer the options every step until the option 4 is made. Switch case is used for the option selection.
