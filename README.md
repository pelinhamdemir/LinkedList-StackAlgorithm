The program makes use of the Student and LinkedList classes to create and manipulate the list of students. The Student class defines the properties and methods of a student object, while the LinkedList class defines the properties and methods of a linked list that stores student objects. Linked stack is used to store the student objects and a linked list to keep track of the students' objects which are sorted according to their ranks. In the main part the infinite loop is created to offer the options every step until the option 4 is made. Switch case is used for the option selection:


option 1: the program prompts the user to enter the student's ID, name, and three grades. The student object is then created and pushed onto the student stack. Additionally, the student object is added to the linked list and the list is sorted based on the average grades of the students.
option 2: the program removes the top student object from the student stack, prints the student's ID, name, and three grades, and displays the student's ranking in the class based on their average grade. The removed student is then also removed from the linked list.
option 3: the program prints a summary of all the students in the student stack. For each student, the program displays the student's ID, name, and three grades, as well as their ranking in the class based on their average grade.
option 4: the program prints the same summary as option 3 and then exits.
